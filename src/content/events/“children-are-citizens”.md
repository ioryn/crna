description: What happens if we were to view children as citizens, not of the
  future, but right now? How would we include their voice in civic decisions and
  what sort of meaningful contributions could they make in our
  communities?  Join the next NAREA Network of Network (NofN) meeting to explore
  this idea further on Tuesday, June 18 from 1-2:30 PM EDT with Mara Krechevsky,
  from Harvard Project Zero.
