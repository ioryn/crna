description: "Calgary Reggio is excited to offer a chance to collaborate with
  and be inspired by your peers! If you’re interested in thinking together with
  others and being either a mentor, mentee or co-collaborator. We’ll endeavor to
  pair you up in order to collaborate and advance your practice throughout the
  2024-2025 year. A Meet and Greet event will be hosted on September 12 (via
  zoom), where you’ll meet your match and discuss the details of your mentoring
  relationship, including meeting times and locations. Interested participants
  will receive an email with the zoom link to this event. We hope you take
  advantage of this wonderful opportunity. "
