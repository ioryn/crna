description: Reimagine waste as a creative material in this hands-on workshop
  focused on education for sustainability. Educators will explore how everyday
  waste materials can become powerful tools for creativity and
  self-expression.  Led by artist and educator Jenny Dale Stables, participants
  will investigate the properties and possibilities of waste materials and found
  objects. Participants will experience how creating with these materials
  fosters problem-solving, collaboration, and personal expression. They will be
  asked to further consider how their creations interact and thrive together,
  fostering a deeper understanding of teamwork and community.  This workshop
  highlights the educator's role in guiding exploration, encouraging dialogue,
  and nurturing meaningful connections between students and their environment
  through creative expression.
