description: Join artist-educator Jenny Dale Stables and investigate the
  properties and possibilities of waste materials and found objects. Experience
  how creating with these materials fosters problem-solving, collaboration, and
  personal expression. Consider how creations interact and thrive together, and
  explore the educatorâ€™s role in guiding exploration, encouraging dialogue and
  nurturing connections.   Presented in partnership with Common Digs at our new
  REimagine Centre!
