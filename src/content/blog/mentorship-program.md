If you are interested in being either a mentor or a mentee please fill out [this form](https://forms.gle/81hYoXhkT4gCXTur5) and we will match you up in order to think together and deepen your practice through collaboration for the 2024-2025 year. We will be having a meet and greet event one evening early in September, where you will be able to meet each other and establish what the mentee-mentor relationship (meeting times, locations, etc.) look like. Interested members will be emailed date and time of the Thinking Together Meet and Greet.
