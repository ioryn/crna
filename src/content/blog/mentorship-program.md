Calgary Reggio is excited to offer a chance to collaborate with and be inspired by your peers! If you’re interested in thinking together with others and being either a mentor, a mentee or co-collaborator, please fill out [this form. ](https://forms.gle/tDsY5dyJWK4uyB7WA)We’ll endeavor to pair you up in order to collaborate and advance your practice throughout the 2024-2025 year. If there is enough interest in this program, we will host a Meet and Greet event on September 12 at 7 PM MST(via zoom), where you’ll meet your match and discuss the details of your mentoring relationship, including meeting times and locations. Interested participants will receive an email with a link to the Thinking Together Meet and Greet. We hope you take advantage of this wonderful opportunity.

This initiative is grounded by Stefania Guamminuti's words in "The Role of the Pedagogista in Reggio Emilia":

\*"In Reggio Emilia, a key practice that is born of the **value of relationality** lies in the provision of, and **co-responsibility** towards, time for c**ollaboration**, **formazione***, and **dialogue** between all staff."* (p.64)

**\*"collectivity, an antidote to the loneliness that affects so many teachers** and educational leaders elsewhere, is enabled by the systemic nature of the educational project of Reggio Emilia...commitment to **collective** organisational principles of **collaboration**, strenuous upholding of education as the common good, and unfaltering efforts towards **participation**. **Collectivity** is thus woven into experience and is felt and valued by all"* (p. 13)

###### \*The term formazione is frequently used in Reggio Emilia to define processes of collective and systemic research, knowledge-building, and professional learning.
