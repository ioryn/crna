FORMATIONS, RE-FORMATIONS AND MALLEABILITIES: WORKING WITH CHILDREN'S IDEAS

Presented by Sylvia Kind and Johanna Po, Capilano University Children's Centre

Engaging in curriculum-making with children means attending to the forming, re-forming, making and re-making of ideas, where ideas are relational, permeable, and malleable, and open to re-compositions. Across two sessions, Sylvia and Johanna will discuss cultivating conditions for collective and experimental thinking, what it might mean to work with children’s ideas, and what these processes might activate.

Session I - Monday, June 17, 6:30-8 p.m. Pacific Time

Session II - Tuesday, June 18, 6:30-8 p.m. Pacific Time
