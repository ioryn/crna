I first met Pat 20 years ago when I was a student working on my art education degree. Her dear friend Carol MacDonnell had just returned from a visit to Reggio Emilia. Carol had appeared in our class draped in glorious red fabric and spark-plug earrings that she had gotten at the Remida Centre. As she described her trip to Reggio, I became instantly captivated and in my heart I thought, " I am home! This is the type of educator I want to become and the image of the child I want to uphold." From there I began joining the informal Reggio network meetings were I first met Pat. I started reading her articles, listened to her share her experiences and observations at our meetings and workshops.

I was over the moon and incredibly fortunate to have her as one of my professors guiding me through my education degree. I still remember my first practicum where I walked into a classroom with printed worksheets covering every surface area and in a school where their image of the child was the complete antithesis of what I believed. It was Pat who got me through that first experience, by listening, offering reassurance and teaching me to questions what I see and to find another way even when it seems impossible. As new educators, she taught us to dive deeply into the uncomfortable and trust the process, and never forget the element of joy. 

Through the years I have had the great pleasure of travelling and presenting with Pat as an art and early childhood educator at conferences. Through these presentations Pat introduced me to community of highly respected art educators who value the 100 languages of children and are leaders in quality art experiences for children in their various contexts. Pat is a highly respected member of this community, always offering to connect individuals where she sees a need or as a way to help others grow their practice.

This same ability to connect individuals has been a catalyst grow our Calgary Reggio Network. Pat has always been able to bring together educators who have the same image of the child and believe in this work. Her passion and dedication has been a driving force to keep this work alive and move it forward in uncertain times. 

The educators in Reggio Emilia have always seen education as a political act. Pat is a champion for this, over the past 25 years she has always advocated for this work, quality education for teachers and children, the 100 languages and of course the image of the child. 

She has taught me to follow your heart and speak your mind when you see injustice and to question those who do not value our work or children.

Through the network and Pat, I have been introduced to so many inspiring educators who have helped develop my educational philosophies and shaped who I am as a person. The network has been a second family to many of us, place where we can go and connect to those like minded individuals to help us work through the challenges we face in education and gain inspiration when it is needed most in our practice. Through this network I have made many life long friends and it is my true professional community. 

Pat has provided hundreds of workshops over the years and touched the lives of many individuals. I am incredibly grateful to have Pat as my mentor and dear friend. I would not be the educator I am today with out her support and guidance over the years. 

From the bottom of my heart, thank you Pat.
