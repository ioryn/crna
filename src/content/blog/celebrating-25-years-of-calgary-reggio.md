Since our inception in 1997 with  "The Hundred Languages of Children Exhibit" until today, Calgary Reggio has been providing inspiration and opportunities for collaboration and dialogue through exhibits, network meetings, book studies, pop-up events and professional learning. As we mark 25 years of dedication to Calgary's educators and children, we continue to forge pathways of possibilities together. 

In celebration of this milestone, we're hosting an Anniversary Fundraising Dinner and Silent Auction, alongside a refreshing update to our branding, highlighted by the launch of this new website generously donated by Cory Zelmer. Currently, we're in the planning stages of developing novel opportunities to support our members exploration of the Reggio philosophy in our quest to re-imagine the educational landscape of Calgary.

We're currently involved in a collaborative project to co-create the REimagine Centre, a creative recycling centre, in partnership with Common Digs Inc. This initiative is inspired by Reggio Emilia's Remida and aims to reimagine how we utilize resource and foster creativity within our community. This innovative space will encompass a materials museum, artist studios, event/exhibition space as well as a laboratory preschool classroom where the Reggio Emilia Approach will be vividly brought to life.   

We're thrilled to embark on this continued journey and  extend a warm invitation for you to join us for the next 25 years of growth, learning and joy!
