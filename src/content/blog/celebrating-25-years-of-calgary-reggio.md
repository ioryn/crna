From "The Hundred Languages of Children Exhibit" in 1997 until today Calgary Reggio has been providing inspiration and opportunities for collaboration and dialogue through exhibits, network meetings, book studies, pop-up events and professional learning.

As we celebrate 25 years of service for Calgary's educators and children we continue to forge pathways of possibilities together. We are marking this event with an Anniversary Fundraising Dinner, Silent Auction and a revamp of our branding including the creation of this new website generously donated by Cory Zelmer. We currently in the planning stages of developing new and exciting opportunities to support our members as we explore the Reggio philosophy and how we can continually re-imagine the field of education.

One of the projects we are engaging in is co-creating  a creative recycling centre along with Common Digs Inc., modelled after Remida, the REimagine Centre. This new space will hold a materials museum, artist studio, event/exhibition space as well as a laboratory preschool classroom to see the Reggio Emilia Approach come to life.   

We can't wait to continue our journey and hope that you will join us for another 25 years!
