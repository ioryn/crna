The simple answer is no.

A method implies a systematic procedure, technique, or mode of doing something. The idea of a method is to follow steps, formats, materials, or intentions that can lead to a specific result. For example, Montessori education is a method, and teachers can be certified as Montessori Guides who are trained to implement the method. On the other hand, the Reggio Emilia Approach to education is free to evolve, and organically grow within a very particular social context. None of the 33 Municipal preschools that serve children from 0-5 years old in Reggio Emilia (Italy), follow the same procedures or formats, although they share a strong philosophical approach and values that permeate the way they work.

In the words of the educators of Reggio Emilia, “The Reggio Emilia Approach is an educational philosophy based on the image of the child with strong potentialities for development and a subject with rights, who learns through the hundred languages belonging to all human beings, and grows in relations with others.” (Reggio Children).  The very particular and irreplicable way that early childhood educators work in the city of Reggio Emilia is a social construction that cannot be replicated as a method in any other part of the World. Still, educators and educational systems around the world take Reggio Emilia’s experience and contributions to transform their educational practices as active protagonists. This is what we call being inspired by the Reggio Emilia Approach.
