As I enter a new school year, I have to answer the age old question, how will I set up my classroom space? How will my classroom feel to my students? Will it feel welcoming, collaborative, and create a sense of wonder?

My first focus was around how to divide my classroom into multiple spaces. These spaces needed to accommodate a variety of purposes. I wanted to make sure all students will have a space that will be conducive to their learning style. My classroom will have a space to gather, to collaborate with peers, and places for solitude. There will be an abundance of material to facilitate learning. One space has literature to create worlds in the students’ minds and is accompanied by soft furniture. However, this area can be used for collaborative work. In the centre of the classroom, there is a rug for whole group gathering as well as collaboration. The studio is filled with organized materials for multiple projects. There is a small table to create a private work area. I also chose to remove a lot of extra furniture to allow an open space and only be filled with furniture that is needed.

Once I figured out the physical space, I needed to figure out the walls. Knowing the classroom is the third teacher. What will my walls be saying to students? I wanted to create curiosity and inspiration with my walls. Students will walk into the classroom and ask questions. After reading “Consider the Walls” by Pat Tarr, I didn’t want to fill the walls, but have small opportunities where students can look at something while moving through the classroom. In my place of solitude, I put images of trees to act as if students were somewhere else. The walls weren’t the only things creating wonder, I have left many natural items around the classroom that offer a tactile experience for students. The art on the walls isn’t permanent, but will be replaced over the year with student work. The walls will reflect who they are and anyone walking into the classroom will be able to see the ideas students are communicating.

Here’s a link to Pat Tarr’s (Calgary Reggio’s President) article[ “Consider the Wall”](https://www.smartbeginningsse.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/considerthewalls.pdf) for you to reflect further on the Environment as a Third Teacher.
