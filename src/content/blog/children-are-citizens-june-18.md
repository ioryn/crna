What happens if we were to view children as citizens, not of the future, but right now? How would we include their voice in civic decisions and what sort of meaningful contributions could they make in our communities?

Join the next NAREA Network of Network (NofN) meeting to explore this idea further on Tuesday, June 18 from 1-2:30 PM EDT.  Mara Krechevsky, from Harvard Project Zero, will present and lead a discussion about a multi-site research project on the topic of “Children Are Citizens”. This topic discusses translating democratic values within our Reggio-inspired classroom practices.
